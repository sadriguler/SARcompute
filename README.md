The algorithm is currently constructed for a specific orientation of Duke and Ella models. Users need to transform the coordinates of their own human body models to the correect locations as in their simulation softwares. 

The performance of the algorithm is accelerated by the Matlab mex capabilities. Users need to run mexSAR.m file before running the algorithm.

The algorithm can be run in two modes, which can be selected by giving the inputs as 1 and 2.
  1. This mode is used to generate the coordinates to export E-field samples, or VoP of the SAR algorithm.
  2. This mode actually runs the SAR algorithm to compute the peak spatial-averaged SAR levels.
